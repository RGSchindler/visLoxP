# visLoxP
This repository contains the script visLoxP written in Python.

Given a genome fasta file, in addition to the files containing the primers for the in silico PCR with the following format: -LoxPUnis,primer_sequence- 

this script facilitates the insilico amplification of LoxP units and its selection based on size.
#######
Note: The size of the amplification units (LoxPunits) with the set of design primers is between 500-300bp.
