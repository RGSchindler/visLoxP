## visLoxP

#Description
visLoxP allows the user to simulate a qPCR in a genome of interest by looking for specific pairs of primers.
Then the user have to provide the following files:
1. Query genome in fasta format and in a single line.
2. Set of forward primers in a .csv file format
3. Set of reverse primers in a .csv file format.

#Usage

#Output

Given a genome fasta file, in addition to the files containing the primers for the in silico PCR with the following format: -LoxPUnis,primer_sequence- 
this script facilitates the in silico amplification of LoxP units and its selection based on size.

----------
Note: The size of the amplification units (LoxPunits) with the set of design primers is between 500-300bp.
